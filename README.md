# Node Smart Proxy
The Node Smart Proxy is an intelligent agent designed to automatically manage web connections, SSL certificates, and server configurations without requiring complex technical operations. It provides a simple, modern, and reliable way to deploy and maintain a secure reverse proxy infrastructure.

## Overview
The Node Smart Proxy connects a local server to a secure online dashboard.  
Once linked, all configurations — domains, SSL certificates, redirects, caching rules, and DNS settings — are automatically synchronized and managed remotely.

Users do not need to manually edit configuration files or restart services. The client handles all technical tasks autonomously while maintaining high levels of performance, reliability, and security.

## Key Features

### 1. Simple and Secure Connection
When first launched, the client generates a temporary activation code.  
The user visits the online dashboard and enters this code to link their server.  
Once linked, the connection is persistent and encrypted. The client securely communicates with the user’s account without exposing any sensitive data.

### 2. Automatic Domain Management
The client automatically detects and configures all domains associated with the user’s account.  
Each domain can be mapped to a local application or service, allowing instant and secure public exposure.  
Adding or modifying a domain can be done directly from the dashboard, without any manual configuration or service restart.

### 3. Automated SSL Certificates
The system handles SSL certificates from creation to renewal, ensuring every domain is protected by HTTPS.  
Certificates are generated automatically and renewed before expiration.  
For advanced users, custom SSL certificates can be imported directly into the client.

### 4. Real-Time Synchronization
The client maintains a continuous connection with the central API.  
Any modification performed on the dashboard—new domain, redirect rule, cache setting—is applied instantly to the server.  
This guarantees real-time updates and zero downtime during configuration changes.

### 5. Intelligent DNS Integration
The client can guide users through DNS setup or automate it entirely when connected to Cloudflare.  
It creates or updates DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME) as needed and verifies propagation before activating SSL.  
This prevents common DNS errors and ensures that each domain resolves correctly.

### 6. Advanced Rule Management
From the dashboard, users can define redirect, rewrite, header, or cache rules.  
The client applies them dynamically without any interruption.  
This flexibility allows fine-grained control over traffic behavior, security headers, and performance optimization.

### 7. Monitoring and Stability
The client continuously monitors proxy uptime, response times, and potential errors.  
It automatically restarts in case of failure to ensure uninterrupted availability.  
Key metrics are reported to the dashboard for visibility and long-term analysis.

### 8. Automatic Updates
The Node Smart Proxy keeps itself up to date.  
New versions are downloaded and applied automatically after validation, ensuring stability and compatibility.  
All updates are seamless and non-disruptive.

### 9. Enhanced Security
Every communication between the client and the server is encrypted using industry standards.  
Tokens and keys are securely stored locally and never exposed.  
Each operation is verified for integrity, providing a tamper-resistant architecture.

### 10. Simplified User Experience
The system is built for both developers and non-technical users.  
Once the server is linked, everything can be managed from the web dashboard.  
The client runs silently in the background, taking care of all network, SSL, and routing operations automatically.

## Vision
The Node Smart Proxy aims to make proxy, SSL, and DNS management entirely effortless.  
It combines simplicity, automation, and strong security into one cohesive system that anyone can use—without the need for manual configuration or technical expertise.

## Target Audience
- Developers looking to expose local applications securely without Nginx or Traefik.
- System administrators managing multiple domains or SSL configurations.
- Companies needing centralized proxy management and SSL automation.
- Individuals or organizations wanting reliable HTTPS hosting without manual setup.
